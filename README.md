This app is an open mic event management app. An open mic is an event hosted by pubs and similar venues to gain new customers and audiences by providing them with entertainment.
When a business creates an open mic event, an artist is supposed to contact the business and let them know that he wants to perform there. This gives him/her a chance to showcase
their talents in a comfortable space. 
Basically, an artist gets a chance to perform in front of an audience without spending time to build one while the business gains new customers who come to see the performance

This app helps to bridge the gap between open mic venues and artists. Once you open the app, you can sign up as a business or an artist. 

If you are an artist:
You are shown what events are available for you to join, you can join them accordingly

If you're a business:
You need to create an event using the app and then the event will be visible to the artist

This app looks to make open mics a convinient affair for both artists as well as businesses.
